Causal inference does not rely purely on data and statistics. It requires more assumptions for causal relationships to be established.


[DAGs](dags.md) are a visual way of expressing our beliefs about how different quantities influence each other.


As it turns out, DAGs are not enough. **Even with infinite data** and a DAGs in place, **some causal relationships cannot be estimated**.
