Some basic definitions and properties needed to understand the material. Here, $A$ and $B$ are random variables, and $\text{E}[\;]$ denotes the expected value operator. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two real numbers.

!!! tip "CHAIN RULE"
    $$p(A,B) = p(A) \, p(B|A)$$

!!! tip "INDEPENDENCE of $A$ and $B$"
    $$p(A,B) = p(A) \, p(B)$$

!!! tip "CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY"
    $$p(A|B) = \frac{p(A,B)}{p(B)}$$

!!! tip "BAYE'S RULE"
    $$p(A|B) = \frac{p(B|A) \, p(A)}{p(B)}$$

!!! tip "LINEARITY of $\text{E}[\;]$"
    $$\text{E}[\alpha A + \beta B] = \alpha\text{E}[A] + \beta\text{E}[B]$$

!!! tip "LAW OF TOTAL EXPECTATION"
    $$\text{E}[A] = \text{E}[\text{E}[A|B]]$$
