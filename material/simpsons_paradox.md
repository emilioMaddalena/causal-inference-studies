# **Simpson's paradox**

---

Simpson's paradox highlights how we can reach **totally opposite conclusions** if we aren't careful in our analyses.

!!! example 

    Doctors have developed **two treatments for kidney stones, A and B**. They want to know which of them is the superior one...

    One doctor goes to a hospital and gets the following data:

    | **Treatment** | **Successes** | **Total** | **Success Rate** |
    |----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
    | A | 81 | 87 | <span style="color:#e3242b;"><strong>93%</strong></span> |
    | B | 234 | 270 | 87% |

    In the meantime, a second doctor goes to a clinic and collects this:

    | **Treatment** | **Successes** | **Total** | **Success Rate** |
    |----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
    | A | 192 | 263 | <span style="color:#e3242b;"><strong>73%</strong></span> |
    | B | 55 | 80 | 69% |

    Clearly both datasets point to A being the best treatment. 🌟

    Here's the plot twist: when the sit down to write their paper, though, they sum up the numbers a suddently...

    | **Treatment** | **Successes** | **Total** | **Success Rate** |
    |----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
    | A | 273 | 350 | 78% |
    | B | 289 | 350| <span style="color:#e3242b;"><strong>83%</strong></span> |

    How can the conclusion change simply by aggregating the data??
