# **Observational data: how confounded?**

!!! tip "TL;DR"
    Observational data is data that wasn't collected via a randomized procedure. As a result, the treatment and control groups will display differences that can confound your analysis.

In many real-world business/medical/social contexts, randomly assigning participants to the treatment and control groups is not possible for economical and/or ethical reasons. 

Picture a group of medical doctors studying the effects of consuming illegal drug X daily. Imagine an e-commerce platform wanting to know the effects giving out a 20% discount voucher has on loyal customers. Consider a social scientist comparing single-sex vs mixed-sex education systems. In none of those cases will randomized data be easy to get!

As a result, many datasets are observational... 

Are all observational datasets created the same, though? or are some more confounded than others?
