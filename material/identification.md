Conditions for identifiability

Key Conditions for Identifiability

    Consistency: The observed outcome equals the potential outcome under the observed treatment.

    Positivity: Every treatment level has a positive probability for each level of covariates.

    Exchangeability / Ignorability: No unmeasured confounding (in the potential outcomes framework).

    Graphical Criteria: Like backdoor or front-door adjustment sets (in structural causal models).

If these hold, identifiability is possible.


Also, full observability does not imply identifiability.
