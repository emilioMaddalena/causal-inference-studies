**Motivation:**

Causal inference can make your ML models generalize better, especially when you want to take robust actions based on them.

It's also a valuable tool to draw conclusions from observational data, when you can't run A/B tests.

**Contributing:** 

- Edit/create new markdowns in `material`, modify the site structure in `mkdocs.yml` if needed
- Numerical examples are welcomed too
- Create a PR! 

We use `mkdocs` to compile the site. To test it locally, install it, then run `mkdocs build` and `mkdocs serve`.
