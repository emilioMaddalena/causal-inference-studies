# causal-inference-studies

Bitesize causal inference lessons for data scientists and ML engineers! :dart:

Here's the site: [causal-inference-studies](https://emiliomaddalena.github.io/causal-inference-studies/)

**Motivation:**

Causal inference can make your ML models generalize better, especially when you want to take robust actions based on them.

It's also a valuable tool to draw conclusions from observational data (when you can't run A/B tests).

**Contributing:** 

- Edit/create new markdowns in `material`, modify the site structure in `mkdocs.yml` if needed.
- Numerical examples are needed (I'm thinking jupyter notebooks).
- Create a PR! :smiley:
