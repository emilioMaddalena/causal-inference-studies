#### Motivation

Causal inference can make your ML models generalize better, especially when you want to take robust actions based on them.

Can't run A/B tests? No problemo! Causal inference can help you estimate the effect of an intervention even from observational data!

#### Contributing

This project is in its infancy 🐥🐥🐥

If you have questions or suggestions for improvement, open an issue! 😄

If you wanna give me a hand... thanks! Help is needed on the following fronts:

- [ ] Adding, in general, more DAG theory and examples
- [ ] Creating a notebook example with a continuous treatment
- [ ] Creating a page to define causal identification and explain why it matters
- [ ] Creating a page explaining the problem of causal discovery 

Check out `CONTRIBUTING.md` for a short guide on how to modify the project and propose new changes!
